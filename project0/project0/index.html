			<h4>About Arctic</h4>
			<p id="arctic">The <b>Arctic</b> region contains a wide range of landscapes; plains, mountains, some very large significant rivers and lakes, rolling hills, huge stretches of tundra and the edge of the largest biome in the world, the taiga. The ice in the Arctic Ocean is largely formed from the frozen sea and contained by the surrounding land masses. It contains a large proportion of multi year sea-ice that is 3-4m (10-13 feet) thick with some much thicker ridges. Greenland has the largest ice cap in the Arctic (and second largest in the world after the Antarctic ice cap) other than this permanent ice is quite rare and relatively small in extent. Ice bergs form when the edges of the Greenland ice sheet reach the sea, most of the ice in the Arctic even in the summer is frozen sea ice.</p>

			<h4>Arctic Wildlife</h4>
			<p id="animals">The Arctic has many large land animals including reindeer, musk ox, lemmings, arctic hares, arctic terns, snowy owls, squirrels, arctic fox and polar bears. As the Arctic is a part of the land masses of Europe, North America and Asia, these animals can migrate south in the winter and head back to the north again in the more productive summer months. There are a lot of these animals in total because the Arctic is so big. The land isn't so productive however so large concentrations are very rare and predators tend to have very large ranges in order to be able to get enough to eat in the longer term. There are also many kinds of large marine animals such as walrus and seals such as the bearded, harp, ringed, spotted and hooded. Narwhals and other whales are present but not as plentiful as they were in pre-whaling days.</p>
