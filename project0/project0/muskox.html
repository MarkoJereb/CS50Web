		<h2>About Musk Ox</h2>
		<p> Musk oxen live in the frozen Arctic and roam the tundra in search of the roots, mosses, and lichens that sustain them. In winter, they use their hooves to dig through snow to graze on these plants. During the summer, they supplement their diet with Arctic flowers and grasses, often feeding near water.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Habitat</h4>
		</p>
		<p>These animals have inhabited the Arctic for many thousands of years, and their long shaggy hair is well adapted to the frigid climate. The outer hairs, called guard hairs, cover a second, shorter undercoat that provides additional insulation in winter. This undercoat falls out when temperatures climb at winter's end. Female musk oxen carry their calves during an eight-month pregnancy, but after birth there is little time to waste. The infants are able to keep up with their mothers and the rest of the herd within a few hours.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Herd Behavior</h4>
		</p>
		<p>Musk oxen are herd animals, and groups of two or three dozen animals are sometimes led by a single female. Herds use cooperation to deal with predation by wolves or dogs. When threatened, they “circle the wagons” and array themselves with their young in the middle and their sharp horns facing outward toward their foes. A cornered musk ox can be a fearsome enemy, charging with its massive bulk and attempting to use its horns to deadly effect. Such defenses are not terribly effective against human hunters, who killed great numbers of musk oxen for their hides and meat. Today, legislation protects herds in Alaska, Norway, and Siberia, where the animals live on preserves.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Diet</h4>
		</p>
		<p>Musk ox are herbivores—eating grass, willows, seeds and berries. In order to find food in the winters, musk oxen will dig into the snow with their hooves and noses. The musk ox find nutrients easily during the summer months—when they can enjoy tasty grasses and seasonal wild flowers. However, during the winter they must depend on roots, mosses, and lichen that grow on the hillides where the snow layer is much thinner. As a result, nutrients is much harder to come by in the winter months. Musk oxen depend on their ability to develop a thick layer of body-fat throughout the spring and summer in order to prepare for the harsh winter season.
		<p>
			<h4>Reproduction</h4>
		</p>
		<p> Males compete for the right to breed with the females by strutting, swinging their heads and ultimately charging into one another head-on. These confrontations are referred to as "ruts". On impact, the brow bands of the horns of each male collide with the other making a loud, distinctive, hollow noise that can be heard for over a kilometer. During the charge toward each other the male muskox can reach speeds of about 50 km per hour, and they may repeat the charge as many as a dozen times before one of them gives up and runs away. The winning male will impregnate all of the females in its herd of about 6 to 12 animals..<br>After mating in the fall, the females remain pregnant through the winter, for 8 to 9 months, giving birth to a single calf in the spring. Twins are possible, but very rare. Each female gives birth to a calf every year or two.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Conservation</h4>
		</p>
		<p>Historically, this species declined because of overhunting, but population recovery has taken place following enforcement of hunting regulations. Management in the late 1900s was mostly conservative hunting quotas to foster recovery and recolonization from the historic declines. The current world population of muskoxen is estimated at between 80,000 and 125,000, with an estimated 47,000 living on Banks Island. In Greenland there are no major threats, although populations are often small in size and scattered, which makes them vulnerable to local fluctuations in climate. Most populations are within national parks, where they are protected from hunting. Muskoxen occur in four of Greenland's protected areas, with indigenous populations in Northeast Greenland National Park, and three introduced populations in Arnangarnup Qoorua Nature Reserve, and Kangerlussuaq and Maniitsoq Caribou Reserves. Within these areas, muskoxen receive full protection.</p>
