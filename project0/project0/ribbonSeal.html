		<h2>About Ribbon Seals</h2>
		<p> Ribbon seals are medium-sized pinnipeds, reaching an average length of 1.50 to 1.75 meters and an average weight of 55 kilograms, with males being larger than females. They have a broad head, big eyes, a long, flexible neck, and a relatively slender, streamlined body. Their fur has a distinctive banding pattern characterized by four white or yellow stripes of varied width against a darker background. Newborn seals have a long, woolly white coat that is molted at weaning</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Habitat</h4>
		</p>
		<p>During the late winter, spring, and early summer, ribbon seals are completely dependent on the presence of sea ice for survival, using it for resting, giving birth, nursing pups, and molting. It also affords them isolation from terrestrial predators and disturbance, space to distribute themselves more widely, proximity to food sources, passive transport to feeding areas, sanitation provided by increased space, and shelter.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Diet</h4>
		</p>
		<p>Studies indicate that the ribbon seal's diet shifts with age and varies regionally. During the first year of life, seals primarily eat planktonic invertebrates; immature seals eat mostly shrimp and other crustaceans; and adults consume mainly cephalopods and fish.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Reproduction</h4>
		</p>
		<p> Ribbon seals are thought to be polygamous, mating shortly after pup weaning. Males are in breeding condition from March to mid-June, and females that had successful pregnancies mate during late April and early May, while those that did not give birth the previous year may mate outside that period. Gestation takes about nine months, after which females give birth on the ice to a single pup. They nurse their pups for three to four weeks.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Conservation</h4>
		</p>
		<p>Currently, the ribbon seal is most imperiled by habitat alteration caused by global warming. Other threats include oil and gas development, shipping activity, pollution, hunting, bycatch mortality, and competition with fisheries for prey.</p>
